# zoomable

[Flickr][]-style “fullscreen” (full viewport) click-to-zoom,
mouse-to-pan for your own `<img>` tags.

## Usage

1. Include the CSS and JS in your HTML document:

        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="zoomable.css">
        <script type="text/javascript" src="zoomable.js"></script>

   Where you choose to include it is up to you; the code does not care.

2. Mark up `<img>` elements with the `zoomable` class as desired.  Make
   sure the images are loading full-size versions so zoomable can simply
   let them expand to their natural size.

3. Open up your document and try it out!
