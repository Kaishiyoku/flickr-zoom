# flickr-zoom

[Flickr][]-style “fullscreen” (full viewport) click-to-zoom,
mouse-to-pan for your own `<img>` tags.

[Flickr]: https://flickr.com

## Usage

1. Include the CSS and JS in your HTML document:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="flickr-zoom.css">
   <script type="text/javascript" src="flickr-zoom.js"></script>
   ```

   Where you choose to include it is up to you; the code does not care.

2. Mark up `<img>` elements with the `flickr-zoom` class as desired.  Make
   sure the images are loading full-size versions so flickr-zoom can simply
   let them expand to their natural size.

3. Open up your document and try it out!
